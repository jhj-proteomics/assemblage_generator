# assemblage_generator

assemblage_generator.py generates a simulated zooarchaeological assemblage. 
The purpose of this code was to provide a random zooarchaeological assemblage for use with testing mni_analyser.py.
assemblage_generator.py will generate a random, simulated zooarchaeological assemblage of ovicaprines, cattle and pigs. 
The script simulates the proportions of ovicarpines, catte and pigs based on my own calculations from Danish archaeological sites dating to the Viking Age.
